# CreditCardChecker
This program checks whether your credit card number is valid (using Luhn Algorithm) and which company your card is from(limited to AMEX, Visa and some Mastercard). 
Some features of this program are from the course I am currently doing. I will update those features soon.

To compile and run the program:
1. make credit
2. ./credit

To use the program:
1. Enter your credit card number
2. The program will check if it is valid
3. The program will output the card company if it is valid
